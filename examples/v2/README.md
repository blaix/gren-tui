To run an example, from the root project folder (the folder with a `gren.json` file):

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Compile the app:

```
npx gren make src/Main.gren
```

Run the app (node 20 or greater):

```
node app
```

Most examples exit on their own, exit with Esc, or tell you how to exit.
Otherwise, you can just Ctrl-C to exit any gren-tui app.
